                    <note>Editorial work for this volume has been supported by a generous gift to
                        the Mark Twain Project of The Bancroft Library from the Koret Foundation and
                        by matching and outright grants from the National Endowment for the
                        Humanities, an independent federal agency. Without that support, this volume
                        could not have been produced.</note>

                        Roosevelt surprised the capital this afternoon by announcing that he would
                        appoint Benjamin F. Barnes as Postmaster of Washington, to succeed John A.
                        Merritt of New York. Mr. Merritt, who for several years has been Postmaster
                        here, has been chosen for Collector of the Port of Niagara, succeeding the
                        late Major James Low<ptr target="#en0002" type="an" xml:id="nv0002"/>.</p><p

                        secretary to the President. Only a short time ago he figured extensively in
                        the newspapers for having ordered the forcible ejection from the White House
                        of Mrs. Minor Morris, a Washington woman who had called to see the
                        President. What attracted attention to the case was not the ejection itself,
                        but the violence with which it was performed.</p><p rend="text-indent:2"
                        xml:id="pa000009">Mrs. Morris, who had been talking to Barnes in an ordinary
                        conversational tone, and with no indications of excitement, so far as the
                        spectators observed, was seized by two policemen and dragged by the arms out
                        of the building and across the asphalt walk in front of the White House, a
                        distance corresponding to that of two ordinary city blocks. During a part of
                        the journey a negro carried her by the feet. Her dress was torn and
                        trampled.</p><p rend="text-indent:2" xml:id="pa000010">She was locked up on
                        a charge of disorderly conduct, and when it was learned that she would be
                        released on that charge a policeman, a relative of Barnes’s, was sent to the
                        House of Detention to prefer a charge of insanity against her so that she
                        would have to be held. She was held accordingly until two physicians had
                        examined her and pronounced her sane. He was denounced by Mrs. Morris, by
                        various newspapers, and by Mr. Tillman in the Senate.</p><p

                    Francisco every little while and enjoy a rest from Territorial civilization.
                    Nobody complained, for he was prodigiously popular. He had been a stage-driver
                    in his early days in New York or New England, and had acquired the habit of
                    remembering names and faces, and of making himself agreeable to his passengers.
                    As a politician this had been valuable to him, and he kept his arts in good
                    condition by practice. By the time he had been Governor a year, he had shaken
                    hands with every human being in the Territory of Nevada, and after that he
                    always knew these people instantly at sight and could call them by name. The

                    disarmed criticism, and even envy. Being the Governor’s wife and head of
                    society, she looked for a proper kind of house to live in—a house commensurate
                    with these dignities—and she easily persuaded Orion to build that house. Orion

                    conversation fell upon Virginia and old times. I was present, but the group were
                    probably quite unconscious of me, I being only a lad and a negligeable quantity.

                    These were eye-witnesses, and with their eyes I saw it all with an intolerable
                    vividness: I saw the black smoke rolling and tumbling toward the sky, I saw the
                    flames burst through it and turn it red, I heard the shrieks of the despairing,
                    I glimpsed their faces at the windows, caught fitfully through the veiling
                    smoke, I saw them jump to their death, or to mutilation worse than death. The
                    picture is before me yet, and can never fade.</p>

                    interested, for I had not before heard of such palatial things from the lips of

                    engagement closed there was but one person in the village who did not believe in
                    mesmerism, and I was the one. All the others were converted, but I was to remain
                    an implacable and unpersuadable disbeliever in mesmerism and hypnotism for close
                    upon fifty years. This was because I never would examine them, in after life.

                        dictation, which has been treated here as an authorial direction rather than
                        as text (see entry at 3.5). Clemens revised TS1 and his changes are
                        incorporated in TS2. Clemens further revised TS2 to serve as copy for NAR,
                        deleting the opening section (up to ‘To continue.’ at 3.42) in blue

                        of 28 March, 29 March, and 2 April 1906; the galley proofs were typeset as a
                        consecutive batch, and this proof was revised by Clemens. Starting with the
                        issue of 4 January 1907, however, the issue length of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >North American Review</hi>was changed from 128 pages to 112. The
                        autobiography installments, which had generally run between 10 and 14 pages,
                        had to be shorter, and the proposed installment was split: in consequence,
                        NAR 11 is made up of an excerpt from the present dictation, coupled with
                        excerpts from the AD of 29 March 1906 (misdated 28 March in NAR).</p>

                    <p rend="noindent">This “dictation” and the two before and after it have their
                        origins in a manuscript—actually an amalgamation of two manuscripts, both
                        evidently written around 1903. The first, from which the present dictation
                        is drawn, has leaves numbered 1–28; it was originally entitled ‘Scraps from
                        my Autobiography. From Chapter IV’. The second is headed ‘From Chapter XVII’
                        and has leaves originally numbered 1–10; it has been renumbered by Clemens
                        to follow on directly from the first. The MS is written on sheets of
                        buff-colored wove paper, measuring 5¾ by 9 inches. It can be dated to 1903
                        by Clemens’s statement that he visited Hannibal ‘a year ago’ (MS page 15,
                        which became a part of the “AD” of 2 December 1906, 301.3–4). In 1906
                        Clemens canceled the original title and retitled it as part of his <hi
                            rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, adding a date of ‘Dec. 1, 1906’ and
                        arranging for Hobby to type the text as a series of three “autobiographical
                        dictations” carrying the dates 1, 2, and 3 December 1906.</p>
                    <p rend="text-indent:2">Hobby typed TS1 ribbon from MS, and Paine reviewed it
                        for possible publication in NAR; marking and querying several passages for
                        possible omission. Clemens revised TS1 ribbon and transferred most of his
                        changes to TS1 carbon, which he sent to the <hi rend="italic">North American
                            Review</hi>for publication without further revision. The dictation was
                        published there together with the ADs of 13 December and 1 December
                        1906.</p>
